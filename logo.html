            <h1>History of the College</h1><br>
            
          Nadar Mahajana Sangam S. Vellaichamy Nadar College was started in 1965 by the “Nadar Mahajana Sangam” with the encouragement of the generous
           donations received from philanthropic members of the Sangam. Kodaivallal, Kalvithanthai Thiru.S.Vellaichamy Nadar of Virudhunagar has contributed
            largely for the creation of this institution by his enthusiastic assistance in all ways. In order to perpetuate his pleasant memory,
             this College has been named after him. The College was inaugurated on 20th July 1965 by our beloved National leader ‘Bharat Ratna’ Thiru. K.
              Kamaraj. Today this co-educational citadel of learning has developed into a postgraduate and research institution imparting quality education
               with the main emphasis on conduct and character development. Even though it is run by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam, the institution caters to
                the needs of all, without any discrimination of caste, creed or religion. The College has planned its work so as to have a well-integrated
                 scheme of instruction, tutorial help and personal guidance coupled with healthy life and community activities to suit individual needs. 
                 The objective is to inculcate the habits of punctuality and the sense of responsibility among students so that they become worthy citizens of India.
            <h1>Vision and Mission</h1>

<h3>Mission</h3>
